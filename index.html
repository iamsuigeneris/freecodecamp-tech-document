           <h3>Introduction To Cryptocurrency </h3>
           <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that functions as a medium of exchange, utilizing the process of cryptography enables users to transact securely using these digital coins. Cryptocurrencies operate on a distributed ledger called a <strong>blockchain</strong>, where all transactions using a cryptocurrency is made public and permanently recorded. Units of a cryptocurrency are produced through a process known as   <strong>mining</strong>, where special computer software is used to solve mathematical problems in exchange for a unit or more of that cryptocurrency. Due to the decentralized technology on which cryptocurrencies operate, the supply of a cryptocurrency is not subject to the control of a central authority; the total supply of a cryptocurrency is normally predetermined, which is made clear to all users.</p>
           <p>Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called <strong>tokens</strong>, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="history">
            <h3>The Origin of Cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p>Starting in the 1980s, there were several developers and innovators who had the idea for money that would exist in the digital realm. These people didn’t get very far with their work. But they at least planted the seed for the future and those who would create cryptocurrency as we know it.These early forms of cryptocurrency were meant to be anonymous payment systems that were verified over a widespread network via a cryptographic process. For whatever reason, none caught on with the public like a certain piece of writing that would be issued in 2008.</p>
            <p>In 2008, someone named <strong> Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> wrote a white paper, which is a technical document explaining some scientific project. They titled the paper  <strong> “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</strong> It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme around this time, someone also registered the domain Bitcoin.org, while Nakamoto published the software allowing Bitcoin to be mined for the first time.
            The identity of Nakamoto has always remained a closely-guarded secret. Various investigative efforts have attempted to learn who this person is and if they used a pen name; some even suggest it is a pen name representing multiple people. In any case, Nakamoto sent some Bitcoin to a friend in 2009, and the world’s first digital currency was born.</p>

            <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
            <p>A blockchain is a public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Each group of transactions are referred to as a <strong> block</strong>, with each block then being combined chronologically into a chain. Information that exists on the blockchain is <strong>shared</strong> and <strong> public</strong>, therefore, every node connected to the network, possesses a copy of the blockchain. Each node will be able to have access to all transactions that have ever taken place, or will take place on the blockchain. The distributed nature of blockchain technology also means that the database cannot be controlled by a single entity, nor can it easily be hacked as there is not one single point of failure. Unauthorized changes to the blockchain would be unlikely, as overriding the network would require a tremendous amount of computing power.
            The first implementation of blockchain technology was by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, where the technology was applied to the digital currency now known as Bitcoin.</p>

                <h3>Cryptocurrency Minning</h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrency mining includes 2 functions: <strong>adding transactions to the blockchain </strong>(securing and verifying)  and  also <strong>releasing new currency</strong> . Individual blocks added by miners should contain a proof-of-work, or PoW.
                Mining needs a computer and a special program, which helps miners compete with their peers in solving complicated mathematical problems. This would need huge computer resources. In regular intervals, miners would attempt to solve a block having the transaction data using cryptographic hash functions.</p>   
                <p>     
                Hash value is a numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies data. Miners use their computer to zero in on a hash value less than the target and whoever is the first to crack it would be considered as the one who mined the block and is eligible to get a rewarded.   
                Earlier, only cryptography enthusiasts served as miners. However, as cryptocurrencies gained in popularity and increased in value, mining is now considered a lucrative business. Consequently, several people and enterprises have started investing in warehouses and hardware.
                As enterprises jumped into the fray, unable to compete, bitcoin miners have begun to join open pools,combining resources to effectively compete.</p>

                <h3>Types of Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                <p>There are about 200 types of cryptocurrencies.We will analyse some major ones below:</p>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>
                    <p>One of the most commonly known currencies, Bitcoin is considered an original cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 as an open-source software. The author of the whitepaper that established this digital currency was under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.     
                    Using blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows users to make transparent peer-to-peer transactions. All users can view these transactions; however, they are secured through the algorithm within the blockchain. While everyone can see the transaction, only the owner of that Bitcoin can decrypt it with a “private key” that is given to each owner.</p>
                    </div>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Litecoin (LTC)</h2>
                    <p>Litecoin was launched in 2011 as an alternative to Bitcoin. Like other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin is an open source, global payment network that is completely decentralized, meaning there are no central authorities.
                    What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin?
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Litecoin is believed to feature faster transaction times.</li>
                        <li>2. The coin limit for Bitcoin is 21 million and Litecoin is 84 million.</li>
                        <li>3. They operate on different algorithms, Litecoin’s being “scrypt” and Bitcoin’s is “SHA-256.”</li>
                    </ul> </p>
                </div>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
                    <p>Created in 2015, Ethereum is a type of cryptocurrency that is an open source platform based on blockchain technology. While tracking ownership of digital currency transactions, Ethereum blockchain also focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application, allowing it to be used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network</p>
                </div>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
                    <p>Ripple was released in 2012 that acts as both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial transactions. It’s a global settlement network that is designed to create a fast, secure and low-cost method of transferring money.

                    Ripple allows for any type of currency to be exchanged, from USD and Bitcoin to gold and EUR and connects to banks, unlike other currencies. Ripple also differs from other types of digital currencies because its primary focus is not for person-to-person transactions, rather for moving sums of money on a larger scale</p>
                    </div>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Bitcoin Cash</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin Cash is a type of digital currency that was created to improve certain features of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash increased the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed faster.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="crypto_names">
                    <h2>Ethereum Classic</h2>
                    <p>Ethereum Classic is a version of the Ethereum blockchain. It runs smart contracts on a similar decentralized platform. Smart contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interface. Like Ethereum, it provides a value token called “classic ether,” which is used to pay users for products or services.</p>

                <h3>Using cryptocurrency</h3>
                <div class="reasons">
                    <h2>1. Low-cost money transfers</h2>
                    <p> One of the most well-known uses of cryptocurrency is for sending and receiving payments at low cost and high speed</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="reasons">
                    <h2>2. Earn interest on Bitcoin and other cryptcurrencies with 'Yield Farming'</h2>
                    <p>Successfully trading crypto for profits requires a lot of time, experience and skill and instead many cryptocurrency owners are holding their coins for long term gain. There are ways to earn steady 'interest' on crypto, though. Popular examples include DeFi lending and crypto staking.</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="reasons">
                    <h2>3. A censorship-resistant alternative store of wealth</h2>
                    <p>While you probably don’t think your bank account and assets could be frozen, the reality is that this occurs more often than people realise — especially in jurisdictions with dubious rule of law. All it can take is for someone to be accused of financial misconduct or making powerful enemies. When that happens, people can find themselves with little to no access to cash, even if they’ve done nothing wrong.
                    This is where one of the most unique and powerful cryptocurrency uses comes into play. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin act as a censorship-resistant alternative store of wealth that only the individual with the private keys to the wallet has access to. Hence, no personal bitcoin wallet can ever be frozen by authorities.</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="reasons">
                    <h2>4. Invest in innovative early-stage startups</h2>
                    <p>The emergence of digital token-based fundraising has allowed anyone with an Internet connection to become an investor in innovative early-stage tech startups, while at the same time providing new startup ventures with much-needed seed capital</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="reasons">
                    <h2>5. Make private transactions</h2>
                    <p>Privacy-centric digital currrencies such as Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and PIVX (PIVX) enable users to make anonymous financial transactions.
                    That means individuals can make money transfers without having to explain to a bank why they are sending a large sum of money, what the sources of the funds are and who they are sending it to, which can delay the transaction and involve unnecessarily bureaucratic processes.</p>

                <h3>Legality of Cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p>The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. According to the Library of Congress, an "absolute ban" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An "implicit ban" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating "bitcoin scams" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions.</p>

                <h3>Future of Cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p>Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market.
                Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies.4Some predict that all that crypto needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF).An ETF would definitely make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there still needs to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which might not automatically be generated with a fund.</p>
